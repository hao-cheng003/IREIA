You may collect the data using your own crawler. (I only collect the data from 2025/1/1 to 2025/12/15, if you could collet more, the residual model will perform better. )
The corresponding script (massland_debug.py) is included in the project folder.

The directory also contains the first 10 rows of cleaned valid sale records from 2025 for reference.
These records are later matched with the main table or the government assessment table using street number and street name, in order to obtain a table containing sale price, sale date, and PID.
These fields are then merged back into the main table and used to train the residual model.
